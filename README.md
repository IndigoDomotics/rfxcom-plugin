#### Changelog

Some updates to Plugin by GlennNZ

#### 2.2.3
Add blindState to BlindsT1234 device - Open/Closed/or Partial 
![](https://github.com/Ghawken/rfxcom-plugin/blob/master/Images/DeviceStatesUpdate.png?raw=true)


Update lastcommand and lastUpdate to include both remote commands, but also Sent commands
Below for Subtype=3 Motorlux Blinds ONLY:
- Add warning message for Blinds subtype=3 may not receive unitcode and will need to be entered for control manually
- Because all unitcodes are sent as 1, any same physical remote devices with different unitcodes/channels will be updated together incorrectly)
- Ideally in this scenario should use a different physical remote for groups of blinds wish to control/be correctly updated in Indigo



#### 2.2.2
Add action Groups Open/Close/Stop/Program/Limit for all BlindsT1234 devices
(obviously all may not work correctly on all devices - but option exists)


#### 2.2.1

Add new device type BlindsT1234 for all type=25 Blinds

(should replace A-OK AC114, Brel, and others, these others left alone so can update as wanted)

Adds Support for SilentGliss Blinds  (Receive Remote commands and send commands)
