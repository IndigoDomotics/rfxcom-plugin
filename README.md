Click the releases link above and download the release youâ€™re interested in.
Once downloaded to your Indigo Server Mac, double-click the .indigoPlugin file
to install.

How to use
----------

Mac OS X Mavericks and above include the required FTDI driver, but previous
versions will require you to install the driver which can be [downloaded from
their website](http://www.indigodomo.com/ftdiurl).

Once you have the driver installed, enable the debug log in the configuration
and open the event log to see which devices are received. Add the devices as
instructed in the event log.
